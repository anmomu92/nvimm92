This is my personal configuration for Neovim. After being a Nvchad user for some time, I decided to set up my own Neovim configuration from scratch. It includes the plugins I find more useful for my personal use, so it may not fit your needs in every way. Also, I am not neither a Neovim nor a Lua expert, so there may be some mistakes that I have not noticed so far. Any help is more than welcome.

## ‚ö° Main features

### Autopairing
> [!NOTE]
> [windwp/nvim-autopairs](https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To move the character outside the enclosing characters without exiting INSERT mode, use `Ctrl+{h,l}` keybinding.

Common enclosing characters are automatically closed when the opening character is typed.

### Top Bar
> [!NOTE]
> [romgrk/barbar.nvim](https://github.com/romgrk/barbar.nvim)

This top bar shows the opened buffers in the current session.

### Status Line
> [!NOTE]
> [nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim)

A visually pleasant and informative status line. It shows information such as git status, encoding or filetype among other. It follows the gruvbox theme.

### Colorscheme
> [!NOTE]
> [ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim](https://github.com/ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim)

It supports both light and dark themes. My favorite colorscheme is gruvbox as it is neither too bright in light mode nor too obscure in dark mode.
