This is my personal configuration for Neovim. After being a Nvchad user for some time, once I decided to set up my own Neovim configuration from scratch. It includes the plugins I find more useful for my personal use, so it may not fit your needs in every way. Also, I am not neither a Neovim nor a Lua expert, so there may be some mistakes that I have not noticed so far. Any help is more than welcome. 

## Basic navigation
- Toggle file explorer: `Alt+n`
- Lazygit: `Alt+g`
- Vertical terminal: `Alt+l`
- Horizontal terminal: `Alt+j`
- Move between panels: `Ctrl+{h,j,k,l}`
- Save: `Ctrl+s`
- Exit: `Esc`
