This is my Neovim *distro* or just my personal configuration for Neovim. After being a Nvchad user for some time, once I decided to set up my own Neovim configuration from scratch. It includes the plugins I find more useful for my personal use, so it may not fit your needs in every way. Also, I am not neither a Neovim nor a Lua expert, so there may be some mistakes that I have not noticed so far. Any help is more than welcome.
